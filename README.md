  <strong>Scan &amp; Sync with SuperScan: Scan documents and sync them across all platforms</strong><br>
  Welcome to the official GitHub repository of SuperScan!
</p>

# Highlights
- Scan documents using native scanning tools (such as MLKit on iOS)
- Sync the scanned documents to desktop using Google Drive
- Extract text directly from scanned documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- Summarize scanned documents with AI
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux)
# Why SuperScan?
Although there are many alternatives that exist, mosty notably CamScanner, I've decided to create SuperScan for the following reasons:
- To make sure that basic features are paywall-free
- To allow the user to freely decide whether to synchronize their scanned documents
- To allow the user to use Google Drive to sync, unifying the user's subscriptions into one space, instead of many
# Feature Roadmap
## Priority Features
- ✅ Beauitful UI
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Document Scanning
- ✅ Save documents into local storage
- ✅ View scanned documents
- Delete and rename scanned documents
- Export scanned documents as PDF and images
- Sync documents with Google Drive
- Implement an in-app feature, nicknamed MagicEyes
### What is MagicEyes?
MagicEyes is a set of AI and algorithm-based features that improves the experience of SuperScan. In MagicEyes, you get the ability to:
- Extract text from documents using system-level OCR
- Summarize documents using AI

**How will the AI features implemented in SuperScan?**

I believe that the best way to implement AI features with MagicEyes is via API Keys. This is so that users who want to use AI (more specifically, OpenAI's ChatGPT) can do so with their own API Keys. And those who aren't interested can choose to not use AI.
### Why Google Drive for Sync?
The reason I've chosen Google Drive is because I want the user to use a cloud storage platform (which the user most likely already has), instead of buying a subscription. It's also easier for me in terms of budget as I don't need to invest in database fees.
## Technicial Features
- Clean code
- Flutter Stage Management
# Release & Download
As of now, SuperScan is still work in progress, and basic features are still being developed. Once I've completed the basic feautures and I'm confident that SuperScan is ready for public release, I'll publish the app to the Google Play Store, and I'll manually release the desktop versions.
## Expected Launch Date
**As APKs on Android, macOS, and Windows**: March 1, 2026
**Google Play Store on Android**: TBA
**Apple App Store on iOS and Apple-notarized app on macOS**: TBA
**Linux**: TBA
## Availability
SuperScan will be available on the following platforms on launch:
- Android
- Windows
- macOS

I'll expand the availability to the other platforms a little while after launch. Other platforms include:
- iOS
- Linux
# Business Model
**Freemium, technically**: I plan to give the user access to all features, with the inclusion of ads implemented in a non-intrusive way. Users will be able to donate me via In-App Purchases or other methods, which will disable ads.
